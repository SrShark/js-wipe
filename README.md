# MagicDrawer
You can find an example on [this link](https://codepen.io/elimparable/pen/VWoZbg).
## Use
for use only need embed the next HTML on your web page:

```HTML
<span class="__modal_drawer"></span> <!-- 1 -->
<div id="drawer_js"></div> <!-- 2 -->
```
1. This element is an opaque background, works as a protector for the content and helps to highlight the drawer.
2. It is literally the wrapper, inside of this you can push all the content for the drawer

----------

For use it only download drawer.js and drawer.css and link to your web, good luck : )
